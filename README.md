## Introduction [&#x219F;](#contents)

This quick-start aims to get you up and running with Haskell, Husk Scheme, and
the FFI for Husk. It will take you from 0 Kelvin to room temperature, putting
within your grasp the heat of the sun's surface.

Below is a quick blurb on each of Haskell and Husk.


### Haskell [&#x219F;](#contents)

The Haskell programming language is a statically typed purely functional
programming language with type inference, concurrency primitives, and lazy
evaluation.

Key Haskell resources:

* [Haskell docs](https://www.haskell.org/documentation)
* [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) (Holy shit!)
* [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours/First Steps](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/First_Steps)


### Husk Scheme [&#x219F;](#contents)

From the [Husk Scheme Github project](https://github.com/justinethier/husk-scheme):

> Husk is a dialect of Scheme written in Haskell that implements a superset of
> the R5RS standard and a large portion of the R7RS-small language. Advanced
> features are provided including continuations, hygienic macros, libraries,
> and a full numeric tower.

One of the key features of Husk is its
[FFI to Haskell](http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/manual/ffi.html), allowing
developers to take advantage of the Haskell ecosystem's libraries within their
Husk projects.

Key Husk resources:

* [User manual](http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/manual/index.html)
* [Haskell interface](http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/manual/haskell-interface.html)
* [Scheme API docs](http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/manual/node106.html)


## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

* An operating system that can support Haskell.
* ``git``
* [Stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#os-x)

## Setup & Build [&#x219F;](#contents)

Once you have ``git`` and ``stack`` installed, you are ready to begin.

### Dead-Simple

The quickest way to build is with the following:

1. Clone the quick-start repo and ``cd`` into the clone directory:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/haskell-lisp/husk-quick-start.git
    $ cd husk-quick-start
    ```

1. Then:

    ```
    $ make
    ```

### Under the Covers

That ``make`` target is actually performing the following.

1. Change to the Haskell project directory:

    ```
    $ cd husk-quickstart
    ```

1. Get the project's supported version of Haskell:

    ```
    $ stack setup
    ```

    At which point you should see something like the following:

    ```
    Preparing to install GHC to an isolated location.
    This will not interfere with any system-level installation.
    ghc-7.10.3:  113.16 MiB / 140.77 MiB ( 80.39%) downloaded...
    ```

1. At this point you are ready to build Husk and its dependencies:

    ```
    $ stack build husk-scheme
    ```

1. And finally, any files we've created in our project (as well as project
   dependencies):

    ```
    $ stack build
    ```

Note that, as long as husk-scheme is downloaded from a published source (i.e.,
declared in the ``extra-deps`` section of the project ``stack.yaml``), you
won't need to explicitly call ``stack build husk-scheme``. However, since we're
using a version of Husk that's only available in the Github repo, we need to
make the extra ``stack`` call.


## REPL [&#x219F;](#contents)

To start the Husk REPL using the local install of Haskell and Husk, run the
following ``make`` target:

```
$ make repl
```

Or use this ``stack`` command (from inside the Haskell project directory):

```
$ stack exec huski
```

```
